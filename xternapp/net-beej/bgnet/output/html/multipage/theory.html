<h2 class="sect1title">2. <a name="theory">What is a socket?</a></h2><hr class="mainsecthr"/>


<p>You hear talk of "<a name="indexId434909-21"></a>sockets" all the time, and
perhaps you are wondering just what they are exactly.  Well, they're
this: a way to speak to other programs using standard Unix <a name="indexId434909-22"></a>file descriptors.</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>Ok—you may have heard some Unix hacker state, "Jeez,
<i>everything</i> in Unix is a file!"  What that person may have
been talking about is the fact that when Unix programs do any sort of
I/O, they do it by reading or writing to a file descriptor.  A file
descriptor is simply an integer associated with an open file.  But (and
here's the catch), that file can be a network connection, a FIFO, a
pipe, a terminal, a real on-the-disk file, or just about anything else.
Everything in Unix <i>is</i> a file!  So when you want to
communicate with another program over the Internet you're gonna do it
through a file descriptor, you'd better believe it.</p>

<p>"Where do I get this file descriptor for network communication, Mr.
Smarty-Pants?" is probably the last question on your mind right now, but
I'm going to answer it anyway: You make a call to the <a name="indexId434909-23"></a><b><tt class="func">socket()</tt></b> system routine.  It returns the
<a name="indexId434909-24"></a>socket descriptor, and you communicate
through it using the specialized <a name="indexId434909-25"></a><b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b>
and <a name="indexId434909-26"></a><b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> (<b class="com"><a href="sendman.html">man
send</a></b>, <b class="com"><a href="recvman.html">man recv</a></b>)
socket calls.</p>

<p>"But, hey!" you might be exclaiming right about now.  "If it's a file
descriptor, why in the name of Neptune can't I just use the normal <a name="indexId434909-27"></a><b><tt class="func">read()</tt></b> and <a name="indexId434909-28"></a><b><tt class="func">write()</tt></b> calls to communicate through the
socket?"  The short answer is, "You can!"  The longer answer is, "You
can, but <a name="indexId434909-29"></a><b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b> and <a name="indexId434909-30"></a><b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> offer much greater control over your
data transmission."</p>

<p>What next?  How about this: there are all kinds of sockets.  There
are <a name="indexId434909-31"></a>DARPA Internet addresses (Internet
Sockets), path names on a local node (Unix Sockets), CCITT X.25
addresses (X.25 Sockets that you can safely ignore), and probably many
others depending on which Unix flavor you run.  This document deals only
with the first: Internet Sockets.</p>







<h3 class="sect2title">2.1. <a name="twotypes">Two Types of Internet Sockets</a></h3>


<p>What's this?  <a name="indexId434909-32"></a>There are two types of Internet
sockets?  Yes.  Well, no.  I'm lying.  There are more, but I didn't want
to scare you.  I'm only going to talk about two types here.  Except for
this sentence, where I'm going to tell you that "<a name="indexId434909-33"></a><a name="indexId434909-34"></a>Raw Sockets" are also very powerful and
you should look them up.</p>

<p>All right, already.  What are the two types?  One is "<a name="indexId434909-35"></a>Stream Sockets"; the other is
"<a name="indexId434909-36"></a>Datagram Sockets", which
may hereafter be referred to as "<tt class="const">SOCK_STREAM</tt>" and
"<tt class="const">SOCK_DGRAM</tt>", respectively.  Datagram sockets are
sometimes called "connectionless sockets".  (Though they can be <a name="indexId434909-37"></a><b><tt class="func">connect()</tt></b>'d if you really want.  See
<b><tt class="func"><a href="syscalls.html#connect">connect()</a></tt></b>, below.)</p>

<p>Stream sockets are reliable two-way connected communication streams.
If you output two items into the socket in the order "1, 2", they will
arrive in the order "1, 2" at the opposite end.  They will also be
error-free.  I'm so certain, in fact, they will be error-free, that I'm
just going to put my fingers in my ears and chant <i>la la la la</i>
if anyone tries to claim otherwise.</p>

<p>What uses <a name="indexId434909-38"></a>stream sockets?  Well, you may
have heard of the <a name="indexId434909-39"></a><b class="com">telnet</b> application, yes?
It uses stream sockets.  All the characters you type need to arrive in
the same order you type them, right?  Also, web browsers use the <a name="indexId434909-40"></a>HTTP protocol which uses stream sockets to get
pages.  Indeed, if you telnet to a web site on port 80, and type
"<tt class="tt">GET / HTTP/1.0</tt>" and hit RETURN twice, it'll dump the HTML back
at you!</p>

<p>How do stream sockets achieve this high level of data transmission
quality?  They use a protocol called "The Transmission Control
Protocol", otherwise known as <a name="indexId434909-41"></a>"TCP" (see <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793" target="_blank">RFC 793</a> for extremely detailed info
on TCP.)  TCP makes sure your data arrives sequentially and error-free.
You may have heard "TCP" before as the better half of "TCP/IP" where <a name="indexId434909-42"></a> "IP" stands for "Internet Protocol" (see <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791" target="_blank">RFC 791</a>.)  IP deals primarily with
Internet routing and is not generally responsible for data
integrity.</p>

<p>Cool.  <a name="indexId434909-43"></a>What about Datagram sockets?  Why
are they called connectionless?  What is the deal, here, anyway?  Why
are they unreliable?  Well, here are some facts: if you send a datagram,
it may arrive.  It may arrive out of order.  If it arrives, the data
within the packet will be error-free.</p>

<p>Datagram sockets also use IP for routing, but they don't use TCP;
they use the "User Datagram Protocol", or <a name="indexId434909-44"></a>"UDP" (see
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc768" target="_blank">RFC 768</a>.)</p>

<p>Why are they connectionless?  Well, basically, it's because you don't
have to maintain an open connection as you do with stream sockets.  You
just build a packet, slap an IP header on it with destination
information, and send it out.  No connection needed.  They are generally
used either when a TCP stack is unavailable or when a few dropped
packets here and there don't mean the end of the Universe.  Sample
applications: <b class="com">tftp</b> (trivial file transfer protocol, a little
brother to FTP), <b class="com">dhcpcd</b> (a DHCP client), multiplayer games,
streaming audio, video conferencing, etc.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!  <b class="com">tftp</b> and <b class="com">dhcpcd</b> are used to
transfer binary applications from one host to another!  Data can't be
lost if you expect the application to work when it arrives!  What kind
of dark magic is this?"</p>

<p>Well, my human friend, <b class="com">tftp</b> and similar programs have
their own protocol on top of UDP.  For example, the tftp protocol says
that for each packet that gets sent, the recipient has to send back a
packet that says, "I got it!" (an "ACK" packet.)  If the sender of the
original packet gets no reply in, say, five seconds, he'll re-transmit
the packet until he finally gets an ACK.  This acknowledgment procedure
is very important when implementing reliable <tt class="const">SOCK_DGRAM</tt>
applications.</p>

<p>For unreliable applications like games, audio, or video, you just
ignore the dropped packets, or perhaps try to cleverly compensate for
them.  (Quake players will know the manifestation this effect by the
technical term: <i>accursed lag</i>.  The word "accursed", in this
case, represents any extremely profane utterance.)</p>

<p>Why would you use an unreliable underlying protocol?  Two reasons:
speed and speed.  It's way faster to fire-and-forget than it is to keep
track of what has arrived safely and make sure it's in order and all
that.  If you're sending chat messages, TCP is great; if you're sending
40 positional updates per second of the players in the world, maybe it
doesn't matter so much if one or two get dropped, and UDP is a good
choice.</p>









<h3 class="sect2title">2.2. <a name="lowlevel">Low level Nonsense and Network Theory</a></h3>


<p>Since I just mentioned layering of protocols, it's time to talk
about how networks really work, and to show some examples of how <a name="indexId434909-45"></a><tt class="const">SOCK_DGRAM</tt> packets are built.
Practically, you can probably skip this section.  It's good background,
however.</p>

<a name="figure1" /><center>
<div><img src="dataencap-120-4.736.png" alt="[Encapsulated Protocols Diagram]"/></div>

<p><b>Data Encapsulation.</b></p>
</center>


<p>Hey, kids, it's time to learn about <a name="indexId434909-46"></a><i><a href="theory.html#figure1">Data
Encapsulation</a></i>!  This is very very important.  It's so
important that you might just learn about it if you take the networks
course here at Chico State <tt>;-)</tt>.  Basically, it says this: a packet
is born, the packet is wrapped ("encapsulated") in a <a name="indexId434909-47"></a>header (and rarely a <a name="indexId434909-48"></a>footer) by the
first protocol (say, the <a name="indexId434909-49"></a>TFTP protocol), then the whole
thing (TFTP header included) is encapsulated again by the next protocol
(say, <a name="indexId434909-50"></a>UDP), then again by the next (<a name="indexId434909-51"></a>IP),
then again by the final protocol on the hardware (physical) layer (say,
<a name="indexId434909-52"></a>Ethernet).</p>

<p>When another computer receives the packet, the hardware strips the
Ethernet header, the kernel strips the IP and UDP headers, the TFTP
program strips the TFTP header, and it finally has the data.</p>

<p>Now I can finally talk about the infamous <a name="indexId434909-53"></a><i>Layered Network Model</i> (aka "ISO/OSI").  This Network
Model describes a system of network functionality that has many
advantages over other models.  For instance, you can write sockets
programs that are exactly the same without caring how the data is
physically transmitted (serial, thin Ethernet, AUI, whatever) because
programs on lower levels deal with it for you.  The actual network
hardware and topology is transparent to the socket programmer.</p>

<p>Without any further ado, I'll present the layers of the full-blown
model.  Remember this for network class exams:</p>

<ul>

<li>Application</li>

<li>Presentation</li>

<li>Session</li>

<li>Transport</li>

<li>Network</li>

<li>Data Link</li>

<li>Physical</li>

</ul>


<p>The Physical Layer is the hardware (serial, Ethernet, etc.).  The
Application  Layer is just about as far from the physical layer as you
can imagine—it's the place where users interact with the
network.</p>

<p>Now, this model is so general you could probably use it as an
automobile repair guide if you really wanted to.  A layered model more
consistent with Unix might be:</p>

<ul>

<li>Application Layer (<i>telnet, ftp, etc.</i>)</li>

<li>Host-to-Host Transport Layer (<i>TCP, UDP</i>)</li>

<li>Internet Layer (<i>IP and routing</i>)</li>

<li>Network Access Layer (<i>Ethernet, wi-fi, or whatever</i>)</li>

</ul>


<p>At this point in time, you can probably see how these layers
correspond to the encapsulation of the original data.</p>

<p>See how much work there is in building a simple packet?  Jeez!
And you have to type in the packet headers yourself using
"<b class="com">cat</b>"!  Just kidding.  All you have to do for stream sockets
is <a name="indexId434909-54"></a><b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b> the data out.  All you have to
do for datagram sockets is encapsulate the packet in the method of your
choosing and <a name="indexId434909-55"></a><b><tt class="func">sendto()</tt></b> it out.  The
kernel builds the Transport Layer and Internet Layer on for you and the
hardware does the Network Access Layer.  Ah, modern technology.</p>

<p>So ends our brief foray into network theory.  Oh yes, I forgot to
tell you everything I wanted to say about routing: nothing!  That's
right, I'm not going to talk about it at all.  The router strips the
packet to the IP header, consults its routing table, <a name="indexId434909-56"></a>blah blah blah.  Check out the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791" target="_blank">IP RFC</a> if you really really care.  If
you never learn about it, well, you'll live.</p>
