<h2 class="sect1title">5. <a name="syscalls">System Calls or Bust</a></h2><hr class="mainsecthr"/>


<p>This is the section where we get into the system calls (and other
library calls) that allow you to access the network functionality of a
Unix box, or any box that supports the sockets API for that matter (BSD,
Windows, Linux, Mac, what-have-you.)  When you call one of these
functions, the kernel takes over and does all the work for you
automagically.</p>

<p>The place most people get stuck around here is what order to call
these things in.  In that, the <b class="com">man</b> pages are no use,
as you've probably discovered.  Well, to help with that dreadful
situation, I've tried to lay out the system calls in the following
sections in <i>exactly</i> (approximately) the same order
that you'll need to call them in your programs.</p>

<p>That, coupled with a few pieces of sample code here and there,
some milk and cookies (which I fear you will have to supply yourself),
and some raw guts and courage, and you'll be beaming data around the
Internet like the Son of Jon Postel!</p>

<p><i>(Please note that for brevity, many code snippets below do not
include necessary error checking.  And they very commonly assume that
the result from calls to <b><tt class="func">getaddrinfo()</tt></b> succeed and return a
valid entry in the linked list.  Both of these situations are properly
addressed in the stand-alone programs, though, so use those as a
model.)</i></p>






<h3 class="sect2title">5.1. <a name="getaddrinfo"><b><tt class="titlefunc">getaddrinfo()</tt></b>—Prepare to launch!</a></h3>


<p><a name="indexId434909-91"></a>This is a real workhorse of a function with
a lot of options, but usage is actually pretty simple.  It helps set up
the <nobr><tt class="type">struct</tt></nobr>s you need later on.</p>

<p>A tiny bit of history: it used to be that you would use a function
called <b><tt class="func">gethostbyname()</tt></b> to do DNS lookups.  Then you'd
load that information by hand into a <nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr_in</tt></nobr>,
and use that in your calls.</p>

<p>This is no longer necessary, thankfully.  (Nor is it desirable, if
you want to write code that works for both IPv4 and IPv6!)  In these
modern times, you now have the function <b><tt class="func">getaddrinfo()</tt></b> that
does all kinds of good stuff for you, including DNS and service name
lookups, and fills out the <nobr><tt class="type">struct</tt></nobr>s you need, besides!</p>

<p>Let's take a look!</p>

<pre class="code">#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;netdb.h&gt;

int getaddrinfo(const char *node,     // e.g. "www.example.com" or IP
                const char *service,  // e.g. "http" or port number
                const struct addrinfo *hints,
                struct addrinfo **res);</pre>


<p>You give this function three input parameters, and it gives you a
pointer to a linked-list, <i><tt class="var">res</tt></i>, of results.</p>

<p>The <i><tt class="var">node</tt></i> parameter is the host name to connect to, or
an IP address.</p>

<p>Next is the parameter <i><tt class="var">service</tt></i>, which can be a port
number, like "80", or the name of a particular service (found in <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers" target="_blank">The IANA Port List</a> or the
<i><tt class="var">/etc/services</tt></i> file on your Unix machine) like "http" or
"ftp" or "telnet" or "smtp" or whatever.</p>

<p>Finally, the <i><tt class="var">hints</tt></i> parameter points to a <nobr><tt class="type">struct
addrinfo</tt></nobr> that you've already filled out with relevant
information.</p>

<p>Here's a sample call if you're a server who wants to listen on your
host's IP address, port 3490.  Note that this doesn't actually do any
listening or network setup; it merely sets up structures we'll use
later:</p>

<pre class="code">int status;
struct addrinfo hints;
struct addrinfo *servinfo;  // will point to the results

memset(&amp;hints, 0, sizeof hints); // make sure the struct is empty
hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;     // don't care IPv4 or IPv6
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM; // TCP stream sockets
hints.ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE;     // fill in my IP for me

if ((status = getaddrinfo(NULL, "3490", &amp;hints, &amp;servinfo)) != 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "getaddrinfo error: %s\n", gai_strerror(status));
    exit(1);
}

// servinfo now points to a linked list of 1 or more struct addrinfos

// ... do everything until you don't need servinfo anymore ....

freeaddrinfo(servinfo); // free the linked-list</pre>


<p>Notice that I set the <i><tt class="var">ai_family</tt></i> to
<tt class="const">AF_UNSPEC</tt>, thereby saying that I don't care if we use
IPv4 or IPv6.  You can set it to <tt class="const">AF_INET</tt> or
<tt class="const">AF_INET6</tt> if you want one or the other specifically.</p>

<p>Also, you'll see the <tt class="const">AI_PASSIVE</tt> flag in there; this
tells <b><tt class="func">getaddrinfo()</tt></b> to assign the address of my local host
to the socket structures.  This is nice because then you don't have to
hardcode it.  (Or you can put a specific address in as the first
parameter to <b><tt class="func">getaddrinfo()</tt></b> where I currently have
<tt class="const">NULL</tt>, up there.)</p>

<p>Then we make the call.  If there's an error
(<b><tt class="func">getaddrinfo()</tt></b> returns non-zero), we can print it out using
the function <b><tt class="func">gai_strerror()</tt></b>, as you see.  If everything
works properly, though, <i><tt class="var">servinfo</tt></i> will point to a linked list
of <nobr><tt class="type">struct addrinfo</tt></nobr>s, each of which contains a <nobr><tt class="type">struct
sockaddr</tt></nobr> of some kind that we can use later!  Nifty!</p>

<p>Finally, when we're eventually all done with the linked list that
<b><tt class="func">getaddrinfo()</tt></b> so graciously allocated for us, we can (and
should) free it all up with a call to <b><tt class="func">freeaddrinfo()</tt></b>.</p>

<p>Here's a sample call if you're a client who wants to connect to a
particular server, say "www.example.net" port 3490.  Again, this doesn't
actually connect, but it sets up the structures we'll use later:</p>

<pre class="code">int status;
struct addrinfo hints;
struct addrinfo *servinfo;  // will point to the results

memset(&amp;hints, 0, sizeof hints); // make sure the struct is empty
hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;     // don't care IPv4 or IPv6
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM; // TCP stream sockets

// get ready to connect
status = getaddrinfo("www.example.net", "3490", &amp;hints, &amp;servinfo);

// servinfo now points to a linked list of 1 or more struct addrinfos

// etc.</pre>


<p>I keep saying that <i><tt class="var">servinfo</tt></i> is a linked list with all
kinds of address information.  Let's write a quick demo program to show
off this information.  <a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/examples/showip.c" target="_blank">This short
program</a> will print the IP addresses for whatever host you
specify on the command line:</p>

<pre class="code">/*
** showip.c -- show IP addresses for a host given on the command line
*/

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;netdb.h&gt;
#include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;
#include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    struct addrinfo hints, *res, *p;
    int status;
    char ipstr[INET6_ADDRSTRLEN];

    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr,"usage: showip hostname\n");
        return 1;
    }

    memset(&amp;hints, 0, sizeof hints);
    hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC; // AF_INET or AF_INET6 to force version
    hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;

    if ((status = getaddrinfo(argv[1], NULL, &amp;hints, &amp;res)) != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "getaddrinfo: %s\n", gai_strerror(status));
        return 2;
    }

    printf("IP addresses for %s:\n\n", argv[1]);

    for(p = res;p != NULL; p = p-&gt;ai_next) {
        void *addr;
        char *ipver;

        // get the pointer to the address itself,
        // different fields in IPv4 and IPv6:
        if (p-&gt;ai_family == AF_INET) { // IPv4
            struct sockaddr_in *ipv4 = (struct sockaddr_in *)p-&gt;ai_addr;
            addr = &amp;(ipv4-&gt;sin_addr);
            ipver = "IPv4";
        } else { // IPv6
            struct sockaddr_in6 *ipv6 = (struct sockaddr_in6 *)p-&gt;ai_addr;
            addr = &amp;(ipv6-&gt;sin6_addr);
            ipver = "IPv6";
        }

        // convert the IP to a string and print it:
        inet_ntop(p-&gt;ai_family, addr, ipstr, sizeof ipstr);
        printf("  %s: %s\n", ipver, ipstr);
    }

    freeaddrinfo(res); // free the linked list

    return 0;
}</pre>


<p>As you see, the code calls <b><tt class="func">getaddrinfo()</tt></b> on whatever you
pass on the command line, that fills out the linked list pointed to by
<i><tt class="var">res</tt></i>, and then we can iterate over the list and print stuff
out or do whatever.</p>

<p>(There's a little bit of ugliness there where we have to dig into the
different types of <nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr</tt></nobr>s depending on the IP
version.  Sorry about that!  I'm not sure of a better way around
it.)</p>

<p>Sample run!  Everyone loves screenshots:</p>

<pre class="screen">$ <b class="com">showip www.example.net</b>
IP addresses for www.example.net:

  IPv4: 192.0.2.88

$ <b class="com">showip ipv6.example.com</b>
IP addresses for ipv6.example.com:

  IPv4: 192.0.2.101
  IPv6: 2001:db8:8c00:22::171</pre>


<p>Now that we have that under control, we'll use the results we get
from <b><tt class="func">getaddrinfo()</tt></b> to pass to other socket functions and,
at long last, get our network connection established!  Keep reading!</p>

 






<h3 class="sect2title">5.2. <a name="socket"><b><tt class="titlefunc">socket()</tt></b>—Get the File Descriptor!</a></h3>


<p>I guess I can put it off no longer—I have to talk about the
<a name="indexId434909-92"></a><b><tt class="func">socket()</tt></b> system call.  Here's the
breakdown:</p>

<pre class="code">#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol); 
</pre>


<p>But what are these arguments?  They allow you to say what kind of
socket you want (IPv4 or IPv6, stream or datagram, and TCP or UDP).</p>

<p>It used to be people would hardcode these values, and you can
absolutely still do that.  (<i><tt class="var">domain</tt></i> is
<tt class="const">PF_INET</tt> or <tt class="const">PF_INET6</tt>, <i><tt class="var">type</tt></i>
is <tt class="const">SOCK_STREAM</tt> or <tt class="const">SOCK_DGRAM</tt>, and
<i><tt class="var">protocol</tt></i> can be set to <tt class="const">0</tt> to choose the
proper protocol for the given <tt class="const">type</tt>.  Or you can call
<b><tt class="func">getprotobyname()</tt></b> to look up the protocol you want, "tcp" or
"udp".)</p>

<p>(This <tt class="const">PF_INET</tt> thing is a close relative of the <a name="indexId434909-93"></a><tt class="const">AF_INET</tt> that you can use when initializing
the <i><tt class="var">sin_family</tt></i> field in your <nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr_in</tt></nobr>.
In fact, they're so closely related that they actually have the same
value, and many programmers will call <b><tt class="func">socket()</tt></b> and pass
<tt class="const">AF_INET</tt> as the first argument instead of
<b><tt class="func">PF_INET</tt></b>.  Now, get some milk and cookies, because it's
times for a story.  Once upon a time, a long time ago, it was thought
that maybe a address family (what the "AF" in "<tt class="const">AF_INET</tt>"
stands for) might support several protocols that were referred to by
their protocol family (what the "PF" in "<tt class="const">PF_INET</tt>" stands
for).  That didn't happen.  And they all lived happily ever after, The
End.  So the most correct thing to do is to use <tt class="const">AF_INET</tt>
in your <nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr_in</tt></nobr> and <tt class="const">PF_INET</tt> in
your call to <b><tt class="func">socket()</tt></b>.)</p>

<p>Anyway, enough of that.  What you really want to do is use the values
from the results of the call to <b><tt class="func">getaddrinfo()</tt></b>, and feed
them into <b><tt class="func">socket()</tt></b> directly like this:</p>

<pre class="code">int s;
struct addrinfo hints, *res;

// do the lookup
// [pretend we already filled out the "hints" struct]
getaddrinfo("www.example.com", "http", &amp;hints, &amp;res);

// [again, you should do error-checking on getaddrinfo(), and walk
// the "res" linked list looking for valid entries instead of just
// assuming the first one is good (like many of these examples do.)
// <a href="clientserver.html">See the section on client/server</a> for real examples.]

s = socket(res-&gt;ai_family, res-&gt;ai_socktype, res-&gt;ai_protocol);</pre>


<p><b><tt class="func">socket()</tt></b> simply returns to you a <i>socket
descriptor</i> that you can use in later system calls, or
<tt class="const">-1</tt> on error.  The global variable <i><tt class="var">errno</tt></i> is set
to the error's value (see the <a href="errnoman.html"><i><tt class="var">errno</tt></i></a> man page for more details, and a
quick note on using <i><tt class="var">errno</tt></i> in multithreaded programs.)</p>

<p>Fine, fine, fine, but what good is this socket?  The answer is
that it's really no good by itself, and you need to read on and make
more system calls for it to make any sense.</p>








<h3 class="sect2title">5.3. <a name="bind"><b><tt class="titlefunc">bind()</tt></b>—What port am I on?</a></h3>


<p><a name="indexId434909-94"></a>Once you have a socket, you might have to associate
that socket with a <a name="indexId434909-95"></a>port on your local machine.  (This
is commonly done if you're going to <a name="indexId434909-96"></a><b><tt class="func">listen()</tt></b> for incoming connections on a
specific port—multiplayer network games do this when they tell
you to "connect to 192.168.5.10 port 3490".)  The port number is used by
the kernel to match an incoming packet to a certain process's socket
descriptor.  If you're going to only be doing a <a name="indexId434909-97"></a><b><tt class="func">connect()</tt></b> (because you're the client, not
the server), this is probably be unnecessary.  Read it anyway, just for
kicks.</p>

<p>Here is the synopsis for the <b><tt class="func">bind()</tt></b> system
call:</p>

<pre class="code">#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

int bind(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *my_addr, int addrlen);
</pre>


<p><i><tt class="var">sockfd</tt></i> is the socket file descriptor returned by
<b><tt class="func">socket()</tt></b>.  <i><tt class="var">my_addr</tt></i> is a pointer to a
<nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr</tt></nobr> that contains information about your
address, namely, port and <a name="indexId434909-98"></a>IP address.
<i><tt class="var">addrlen</tt></i> is the length in bytes of that address.</p>

<p>Whew.  That's a bit to absorb in one chunk.  Let's have an
example that binds the socket to the host the program is running on,
port 3490:</p>

<pre class="code">struct addrinfo hints, *res;
int sockfd;

// first, load up address structs with getaddrinfo():

memset(&amp;hints, 0, sizeof hints);
hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;  // use IPv4 or IPv6, whichever
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
hints.ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE;     // fill in my IP for me

getaddrinfo(NULL, "3490", &amp;hints, &amp;res);

// make a socket:

sockfd = socket(res-&gt;ai_family, res-&gt;ai_socktype, res-&gt;ai_protocol);

// bind it to the port we passed in to getaddrinfo():

bind(sockfd, res-&gt;ai_addr, res-&gt;ai_addrlen);</pre>


<p>By using the <tt class="const">AI_PASSIVE</tt> flag, I'm telling the program
to bind to the IP of the host it's running on.  If you want to bind to a
specific local IP address, drop the <tt class="const">AI_PASSIVE</tt> and put an
IP address in for the first argument to <b><tt class="func">getaddrinfo()</tt></b>.</p>

<p><b><tt class="func">bind()</tt></b> also returns <tt class="const">-1</tt>
on error and sets <i><tt class="var">errno</tt></i> to the error's
value.</p>

<p>Lots of old code manually packs the <nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr_in</tt></nobr>
before calling <b><tt class="func">bind()</tt></b>.  Obviously this is IPv4-specific,
but there's really nothing stopping you from doing the same thing with
IPv6, except that using <b><tt class="func">getaddrinfo()</tt></b> is going to be
easier, generally.  Anyway, the old code looks something like this:</p>

<pre class="code">// !!! THIS IS THE OLD WAY !!!

int sockfd;
struct sockaddr_in my_addr;

sockfd = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

my_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
my_addr.sin_port = htons(MYPORT);     // short, network byte order
my_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("10.12.110.57");
memset(my_addr.sin_zero, '\0', sizeof my_addr.sin_zero);

bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;my_addr, sizeof my_addr);</pre>


<p>In the above code, you could also assign <tt class="const">INADDR_ANY</tt> to
the <i><tt class="var">s_addr</tt></i> field if you wanted to bind to your local IP
address (like the <tt class="const">AI_PASSIVE</tt> flag, above.)  The IPv6
version of <tt class="const">INADDR_ANY</tt> is a global variable
<i><tt class="var">in6addr_any</tt></i> that is assigned into the <i><tt class="var">sin6_addr</tt></i>
field of your <nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr_in6</tt></nobr>.  (There is also a macro
<tt class="const">IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT</tt> that you can use in a variable
initializer.)</p>

<p>Another thing to watch out for when calling <b><tt class="func">bind()</tt></b>:
don't go underboard with your port numbers.  <a name="indexId434909-99"></a>All ports
below 1024 are RESERVED (unless you're the superuser)!  You can have any
port number above that, right up to 65535 (provided they aren't already
being used by another program.)</p>

<p>Sometimes, you might notice, you try to rerun a server and
<b><tt class="func">bind()</tt></b> fails, claiming <a name="indexId434909-100"></a>"Address
already in use." What does that mean?  Well, a little bit of a socket
that was connected is still hanging around in the kernel, and it's
hogging the port.  You can either wait for it to clear (a minute or so),
or add code to your program allowing it to reuse the port, like
this:</p>

<pre class="code"><a name="indexId434909-101"></a><a name="indexId434909-102"></a>int yes=1;
//char yes='1'; // Solaris people use this

// lose the pesky "Address already in use" error message
if (setsockopt(listener,SOL_SOCKET,SO_REUSEADDR,&amp;yes,sizeof(int)) == -1) {
    perror("setsockopt");
    exit(1);
} 
</pre>


<p><a name="indexId434909-103"></a>One small extra final note about
<b><tt class="func">bind()</tt></b>: there are times when you won't absolutely have to
call it.  If you are <a name="indexId434909-104"></a><b><tt class="func">connect()</tt></b>ing to a
remote machine and you don't care what your local port is (as is the
case with <b class="com">telnet</b> where you only care about the remote port),
you can simply call <b><tt class="func">connect()</tt></b>, it'll check to see if the
socket is unbound, and will <b><tt class="func">bind()</tt></b> it to an unused local
port if necessary.</p>








<h3 class="sect2title">5.4. <a name="connect"><b><tt class="titlefunc">connect()</tt></b>—Hey, you!</a></h3>


<p><a name="indexId434909-105"></a>Let's just pretend for a few minutes that you're
a telnet application.  Your user commands you (just like in the movie
<a name="indexId434909-106"></a><i>TRON</i>) to get a socket file descriptor.  You
comply and call <b><tt class="func">socket()</tt></b>.  Next, the user tells you to
connect to "<tt class="tt">10.12.110.57</tt>" on port "<tt class="tt">23</tt>" (the standard
telnet port.)  Yow!  What do you do now?</p>

<p>Lucky for you, program, you're now perusing the section on
<b><tt class="func">connect()</tt></b>—how to connect to a remote host.  So read
furiously onward!  No time to lose!</p>

<p>The <b><tt class="func">connect()</tt></b> call is as follows:</p>

<pre class="code">#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

int connect(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *serv_addr, int addrlen); 
</pre>


<p><i><tt class="var">sockfd</tt></i> is our friendly neighborhood socket
file descriptor, as returned by the <b><tt class="func">socket()</tt></b> call,
<i><tt class="var">serv_addr</tt></i> is a <nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr</tt></nobr>
containing the destination port and IP address, and
<i><tt class="var">addrlen</tt></i> is the length in bytes of the server address
structure.</p>

<p>All of this information can be gleaned from the results of the
<b><tt class="func">getaddrinfo()</tt></b> call, which rocks.</p>

<p>Is this starting to make more sense?  I can't hear you from here, so
I'll just have to hope that it is.  Let's have an example where we make
a socket connection to "www.example.com", port 3490:</p>

<pre class="code">struct addrinfo hints, *res;
int sockfd;

// first, load up address structs with getaddrinfo():

memset(&amp;hints, 0, sizeof hints);
hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;

getaddrinfo("www.example.com", "3490", &amp;hints, &amp;res);

// make a socket:

sockfd = socket(res-&gt;ai_family, res-&gt;ai_socktype, res-&gt;ai_protocol);

// connect!

connect(sockfd, res-&gt;ai_addr, res-&gt;ai_addrlen);</pre>


<p>Again, old-school programs filled out their own <nobr><tt class="type">struct
sockaddr_in</tt></nobr>s to pass to <b><tt class="func">connect()</tt></b>.  You can do that
if you want to.  See the similar note in the <a href="syscalls.html#bind"><b><tt class="func">bind()</tt></b> section</a>, above.</p>

<p>Be sure to check the return value from
<b><tt class="func">connect()</tt></b>—it'll return <tt class="const">-1</tt> on error
and set the variable <i><tt class="var">errno</tt></i>.</p>

<p><a name="indexId434909-107"></a>Also, notice that we didn't call
<b><tt class="func">bind()</tt></b>.  Basically, we don't care about our local port
number; we only care where we're going (the remote port).  The kernel
will choose a local port for us, and the site we connect to will
automatically get this information from us.  No worries.</p>








<h3 class="sect2title">5.5. <a name="listen"><b><tt class="titlefunc">listen()</tt></b>—Will somebody please call
me?</a></h3>


<p><a name="indexId434909-108"></a>Ok, time for a change of pace.  What if you don't
want to connect to a remote host.  Say, just for kicks, that you want to
wait for incoming connections and handle them in some way.  The process
is two step: first you <b><tt class="func">listen()</tt></b>, then you
<a name="indexId434909-109"></a><b><tt class="func">accept()</tt></b> (see below.)</p>

<p>The listen call is fairly simple, but requires a bit of
explanation:</p>

<pre class="code">int listen(int sockfd, int backlog); 
</pre>


<p><i><tt class="var">sockfd</tt></i> is the usual socket file descriptor
from the <b><tt class="func">socket()</tt></b> system call.
<a name="indexId434909-110"></a><i><tt class="var">backlog</tt></i> is the number of
connections allowed on the incoming queue.  What does that mean?  Well,
incoming connections are going to wait in this queue until you
<b><tt class="func">accept()</tt></b> them (see below) and this is the limit on how many
can queue up.  Most systems silently limit this number to about 20; you
can probably get away with setting it to <tt class="const">5</tt> or
<tt class="const">10</tt>.</p>

<p>Again, as per usual, <b><tt class="func">listen()</tt></b> returns
<tt class="const">-1</tt> and sets <i><tt class="var">errno</tt></i> on
error.</p>

<p>Well, as you can probably imagine, we need to call
<b><tt class="func">bind()</tt></b> before we call <b><tt class="func">listen()</tt></b> so that the
server is running on a specific port.  (You have to be able to tell your
buddies which port to connect to!)  So if you're going to be listening
for incoming connections, the sequence of system calls you'll make
is:</p>

<pre class="code">getaddrinfo();
socket();
bind();
listen();
/* accept() goes here */ 
</pre>


<p>I'll just leave that in the place of sample code, since it's
fairly self-explanatory.  (The code in the <b><tt class="func">accept()</tt></b>
section, below, is more complete.)  The really tricky part of this whole
sha-bang is the call to <b><tt class="func">accept()</tt></b>.</p>








<h3 class="sect2title">5.6. <a name="accept"><b><tt class="titlefunc">accept()</tt></b>—"Thank you for calling port
3490."</a></h3>


<p><a name="indexId434909-111"></a>Get ready—the <b><tt class="func">accept()</tt></b> call
is kinda weird!  What's going to happen is this: someone far far away
will try to <b><tt class="func">connect()</tt></b> to your machine on a port that you
are <b><tt class="func">listen()</tt></b>ing on.  Their connection will be queued up
waiting to be <b><tt class="func">accept()</tt></b>ed.  You call <b><tt class="func">accept()</tt></b>
and you tell it to get the pending connection.  It'll return to you a
<i>brand new socket file descriptor</i> to use for this single
connection!  That's right, suddenly you have <i>two socket file
descriptors</i> for the price of one!  The original one is still
listening for more new connections, and the newly created one is finally
ready to <b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b> and <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b>.  We're there! </p>

<p>The call is as follows:</p>

<pre class="code">#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

int accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen); 
</pre>


<p><i><tt class="var">sockfd</tt></i> is the
<b><tt class="func">listen()</tt></b>ing socket descriptor.  Easy enough.
<i><tt class="var">addr</tt></i> will usually be a pointer to a local
<nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr_storage</tt></nobr>.  This is where the information
about the incoming connection will go (and with it you can determine
which host is calling you from which port).  <i><tt class="var">addrlen</tt></i> is a
local integer variable that should be set to <tt class="tt">sizeof(struct
sockaddr_storage)</tt> before its address is passed to
<b><tt class="func">accept()</tt></b>.  <b><tt class="func">accept()</tt></b> will not put more than
that many bytes into <i><tt class="var">addr</tt></i>.  If it puts fewer in, it'll
change the value of <i><tt class="var">addrlen</tt></i> to reflect that.</p>

<p>Guess what?  <b><tt class="func">accept()</tt></b> returns <tt class="const">-1</tt> and sets
<i><tt class="var">errno</tt></i> if an error occurs.  Betcha didn't figure that.</p>

<p>Like before, this is a bunch to absorb in one chunk, so here's a
sample code fragment for your perusal:</p>

<pre class="code">#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;

#define MYPORT "3490"  // the port users will be connecting to
#define BACKLOG 10     // how many pending connections queue will hold

int main(void)
{
    struct sockaddr_storage their_addr;
    socklen_t addr_size;
    struct addrinfo hints, *res;
    int sockfd, new_fd;

    // !! don't forget your error checking for these calls !!

    // first, load up address structs with getaddrinfo():

    memset(&amp;hints, 0, sizeof hints);
    hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;  // use IPv4 or IPv6, whichever
    hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
    hints.ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE;     // fill in my IP for me

    getaddrinfo(NULL, MYPORT, &amp;hints, &amp;res);

    // make a socket, bind it, and listen on it:

    sockfd = socket(res-&gt;ai_family, res-&gt;ai_socktype, res-&gt;ai_protocol);
    bind(sockfd, res-&gt;ai_addr, res-&gt;ai_addrlen);
    listen(sockfd, BACKLOG);

    // now accept an incoming connection:

    addr_size = sizeof their_addr;
    new_fd = accept(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;their_addr, &amp;addr_size);

    // ready to communicate on socket descriptor new_fd!
    .
    .
    .</pre>


<p>Again, note that we will use the socket descriptor
<i><tt class="var">new_fd</tt></i> for all <b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b> and
<b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> calls.  If you're only getting one single connection
ever, you can <b><tt class="func">close()</tt></b> the listening <i><tt class="var">sockfd</tt></i>
in order to prevent more incoming connections on the same port, if you
so desire.</p>








<h3 class="sect2title">5.7. <a name="sendrecv"><b><tt class="titlefunc">send()</tt></b> and <b><tt class="titlefunc">recv()</tt></b>—Talk to me,
baby!</a></h3>


<p>These two functions are for communicating over stream sockets or
connected datagram sockets.  If you want to use regular unconnected
datagram sockets, you'll need to see the section on <a href="syscalls.html#sendtorecv"><b><tt class="func">sendto()</tt></b> and
<b><tt class="func">recvfrom()</tt></b></a>, below.</p>

<p><a name="indexId434909-112"></a>The <b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b> call:</p>

<pre class="code">int send(int sockfd, const void *msg, int len, int flags); 
</pre>


<p><i><tt class="var">sockfd</tt></i> is the socket descriptor you want to
send data to (whether it's the one returned by
<b><tt class="func">socket()</tt></b> or the one you got with
<b><tt class="func">accept()</tt></b>.) <i><tt class="var">msg</tt></i> is a pointer
to the data you want to send, and <i><tt class="var">len</tt></i> is the
length of that data in bytes.  Just set <i><tt class="var">flags</tt></i> to
<tt class="const">0</tt>.  (See the <b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b> man page
for more information concerning flags.)</p>

<p>Some sample code might be:</p>

<pre class="code">char *msg = "Beej was here!";
int len, bytes_sent;
.
.
.
len = strlen(msg);
bytes_sent = send(sockfd, msg, len, 0);
.
.
. 
</pre>


<p><b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b> returns the number of bytes actually
sent out—<i>this might be less than the number you told it to
send!</i>  See, sometimes you tell it to send a whole gob of data and
it just can't handle it.  It'll fire off as much of the data as it can,
and trust you to send the rest later.  Remember, if the value returned
by <b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b> doesn't match the value in <i><tt class="var">len</tt></i>,
it's up to you to send the rest of the string.  The good news is this:
if the packet is small (less than 1K or so) it will <i>probably</i>
manage to send the whole thing all in one go.  Again, <tt class="const">-1</tt>
is returned on error, and <i><tt class="var">errno</tt></i> is set to the error
number.</p>

<p><a name="indexId434909-113"></a>The <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> call is similar in many
respects:</p>

<pre class="code">int recv(int sockfd, void *buf, int len, int flags);</pre>


<p><i><tt class="var">sockfd</tt></i> is the socket descriptor to read
from, <i><tt class="var">buf</tt></i> is the buffer to read the information
into, <i><tt class="var">len</tt></i> is the maximum length of the buffer,
and <i><tt class="var">flags</tt></i> can again be set to
<tt class="const">0</tt>.  (See the <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> man page
for flag information.)</p>

<p><b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> returns the number of bytes actually
read into the buffer, or <tt class="const">-1</tt> on error (with
<i><tt class="var">errno</tt></i> set, accordingly.)</p>

<p>Wait!  <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> can return
<tt class="const">0</tt>.  This can mean only one thing: the remote side
has closed the connection on you!  A return value of
<tt class="const">0</tt> is <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b>'s way of letting
you know this has occurred.</p>

<p>There, that was easy, wasn't it?  You can now pass data back and
forth on stream sockets!  Whee!  You're a Unix Network
Programmer!</p>








<h3 class="sect2title">5.8. <a name="sendtorecv"><b><tt class="titlefunc">sendto()</tt></b> and
<b><tt class="titlefunc">recvfrom()</tt></b>—Talk to me, DGRAM-style</a></h3>


<p><a name="indexId434909-114"></a>"This is all fine and dandy," I hear you
saying, "but where does this leave me with unconnected datagram
sockets?"  No problemo, amigo.  We have just the thing.</p>

<p>Since datagram sockets aren't connected to a remote host, guess which
piece of information we need to give before we send a packet?  That's
right!  The destination address!  Here's the scoop:</p>

<pre class="code">int sendto(int sockfd, const void *msg, int len, unsigned int flags,
           const struct sockaddr *to, socklen_t tolen); </pre>


<p>As you can see, this call is basically the same as the call to
<b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b> with the addition of two other pieces of
information.  <i><tt class="var">to</tt></i> is a pointer to a <nobr><tt class="type">struct
sockaddr</tt></nobr> (which will probably be another <nobr><tt class="type">struct
sockaddr_in</tt></nobr> or <nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr_in6</tt></nobr> or <nobr><tt class="type">struct
sockaddr_storage</tt></nobr> that you cast at the last minute) which contains
the destination <a name="indexId434909-115"></a>IP address and <a name="indexId434909-116"></a>port.
<i><tt class="var">tolen</tt></i>, an <nobr><tt class="type">int</tt></nobr> deep-down, can simply be set
to <tt class="tt">sizeof *to</tt> or <tt class="tt">sizeof(struct sockaddr_storage)</tt>.</p>

<p>To get your hands on the destination address structure, you'll
probably either get it from <b><tt class="func">getaddrinfo()</tt></b>, or from
<b><tt class="func">recvfrom()</tt></b>, below, or you'll fill it out by hand.</p>

<p>Just like with <b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b>,
<b><tt class="func">sendto()</tt></b> returns the number of bytes actually sent
(which, again, might be less than the number of bytes you told it to
send!), or <tt class="const">-1</tt> on error.</p>

<p>Equally similar are <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> and
<a name="indexId434909-117"></a><b><tt class="func">recvfrom()</tt></b>.  The synopsis of
<b><tt class="func">recvfrom()</tt></b> is:</p>

<pre class="code">int recvfrom(int sockfd, void *buf, int len, unsigned int flags,
             struct sockaddr *from, int *fromlen); </pre>


<p>Again, this is just like <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> with the
addition of a couple fields.  <i><tt class="var">from</tt></i> is a pointer to a
local <a name="indexId434909-118"></a><nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr_storage</tt></nobr>
that will be filled with the IP address and port of the originating
machine.  <i><tt class="var">fromlen</tt></i> is a pointer to a local
<nobr><tt class="type">int</tt></nobr> that should be initialized to <tt class="tt">sizeof *from</tt> or
<tt class="tt">sizeof(struct sockaddr_storage)</tt>.  When the function returns,
<i><tt class="var">fromlen</tt></i> will contain the length of the address actually
stored in <i><tt class="var">from</tt></i>.</p>

<p><b><tt class="func">recvfrom()</tt></b> returns the number of bytes
received, or <tt class="const">-1</tt> on error (with
<i><tt class="var">errno</tt></i> set accordingly.)</p>

<p>So, here's a question: why do we use <nobr><tt class="type">struct
sockaddr_storage</tt></nobr> as the socket type?  Why not <nobr><tt class="type">struct
sockaddr_in</tt></nobr>?  Because, you see, we want to not tie ourselves down
to IPv4 or IPv6.  So we use the generic <nobr><tt class="type">struct
sockaddr_storage</tt></nobr> which we know will be big enough for either.</p>

<p>(So... here's another question: why isn't <nobr><tt class="type">struct
sockaddr</tt></nobr> itself big enough for any address?  We even cast the
general-purpose <nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr_storage</tt></nobr> to the
general-purpose <nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr</tt></nobr>!  Seems extraneous and
redundant, huh.  The answer is, it just isn't big enough, and I'd guess
that changing it at this point would be Problematic.  So they made a new
one.)</p>

<p>Remember, if you <a name="indexId434909-119"></a><b><tt class="func">connect()</tt></b> a datagram
socket, you can then simply use <b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b> and
<b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> for all your transactions.  The socket itself is
still a datagram socket and the packets still use UDP, but the socket
interface will automatically add the destination and source information
for you.</p>










<h3 class="sect2title">5.9. <a name="closedown"><b><tt class="titlefunc">close()</tt></b> and
<b><tt class="titlefunc">shutdown()</tt></b>—Get outta my face!</a></h3>


<p>Whew!  You've been <b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b>ing and
<b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b>ing data all day long, and you've had it.
You're ready to close the connection on your socket descriptor.  This is
easy.  You can just use the regular Unix file descriptor
<a name="indexId434909-120"></a><b><tt class="func">close()</tt></b> function:</p>

<pre class="code">close(sockfd); 
</pre>


<p>This will prevent any more reads and writes to the socket.  Anyone
attempting to read or write the socket on the remote end will receive an
error.</p>

<p>Just in case you want a little more control over how the socket
closes, you can use the <a name="indexId434909-121"></a><b><tt class="func">shutdown()</tt></b>
function.  It allows you to cut off communication in a certain
direction, or both ways (just like <b><tt class="func">close()</tt></b> does.)
Synopsis:</p>

<pre class="code">int shutdown(int sockfd, int how); 
</pre>


<p><i><tt class="var">sockfd</tt></i> is the socket file descriptor you
want to shutdown, and <i><tt class="var">how</tt></i> is one of the
following:</p>

<p><center><table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" border="0" class="joetable">

<tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="10%%"><p><tt class="const">0</tt></p></td>
<td valign="top" align="left" width="88%%"><p>Further receives are disallowed</p></td>
</tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="left"><p><tt class="const">1</tt></p></td>
<td valign="top" align="left"><p>Further sends are disallowed</p></td>
</tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="left"><p><tt class="const">2</tt></p></td>
<td valign="top" align="left"><p>Further sends and receives are disallowed (like <b><tt class="func">close()</tt></b>)</p></td>
</tr>

</table></center>
</p>

<p><b><tt class="func">shutdown()</tt></b> returns <tt class="const">0</tt> on
success, and <tt class="const">-1</tt> on error (with
<i><tt class="var">errno</tt></i> set accordingly.)</p>

<p>If you deign to use <b><tt class="func">shutdown()</tt></b> on unconnected
datagram sockets, it will simply make the socket unavailable for further
<b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b> and <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> calls
(remember that you can use these if you <b><tt class="func">connect()</tt></b>
your datagram socket.)</p>

<p>It's important to note that <b><tt class="func">shutdown()</tt></b>
doesn't actually close the file descriptor—it just changes its
usability.  To free a socket descriptor, you need to use
<b><tt class="func">close()</tt></b>.</p>

<p>Nothing to it.</p>

<p>(Except to remember that if you're using <a name="indexId434909-122"></a>Windows
and <a name="indexId434909-123"></a>Winsock that you should call <a name="indexId434909-124"></a><b><tt class="func">closesocket()</tt></b> instead of
<b><tt class="func">close()</tt></b>.)</p>









<h3 class="sect2title">5.10. <a name="getpeername"><b><tt class="titlefunc">getpeername()</tt></b>—Who are you?</a></h3>


<p><a name="indexId434909-125"></a>This function is so easy.</p>

<p>It's so easy, I almost didn't give it its own section.  But here
it is anyway.</p>

<p>The function <b><tt class="func">getpeername()</tt></b> will tell you who is at the other end
of a connected stream socket.  The synopsis:</p>

<pre class="code">#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

int getpeername(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, int *addrlen); 
</pre>


<p><i><tt class="var">sockfd</tt></i> is the descriptor of the connected
stream socket, <i><tt class="var">addr</tt></i> is a pointer to a
<nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr</tt></nobr> (or a <nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr_in</tt></nobr>) that
will hold the information about the other side of the connection, and
<i><tt class="var">addrlen</tt></i> is a pointer to an <nobr><tt class="type">int</tt></nobr>, that
should be initialized to <tt class="tt">sizeof *addr</tt> or <tt class="tt">sizeof(struct
sockaddr)</tt>.</p>

<p>The function returns <tt class="const">-1</tt> on error and sets
<i><tt class="var">errno</tt></i> accordingly.</p>

<p>Once you have their address, you can use <a name="indexId434909-126"></a><b><tt class="func">inet_ntop()</tt></b>, <a name="indexId434909-127"></a><b><tt class="func">getnameinfo()</tt></b>, or <a name="indexId434909-128"></a><b><tt class="func">gethostbyaddr()</tt></b> to print or get more
information.  No, you can't get their login name.  (Ok, ok.  If the
other computer is running an ident daemon, this is possible.  This,
however, is beyond the scope of this document.  Check out <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1413" target="_blank">RFC 1413</a> for more info.)</p>









<h3 class="sect2title">5.11. <a name="gethostname"><b><tt class="titlefunc">gethostname()</tt></b>—Who am I?</a></h3>


<p><a name="indexId434909-129"></a>Even easier than <b><tt class="func">getpeername()</tt></b>
is the function <b><tt class="func">gethostname()</tt></b>.  It returns the name of the
computer that your program is running on.  The name can then be used by
<a name="indexId434909-130"></a><b><tt class="func">gethostbyname()</tt></b>, below, to
determine the <a name="indexId434909-131"></a>IP address of your local machine.</p>

<p>What could be more fun?  I could think of a few things, but they
don't pertain to socket programming.  Anyway, here's the
breakdown:</p>

<pre class="code">#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int gethostname(char *hostname, size_t size); 
</pre>


<p>The arguments are simple: <i><tt class="var">hostname</tt></i> is a
pointer to an array of chars that will contain the hostname upon the
function's return, and <i><tt class="var">size</tt></i> is the length in
bytes of the <i><tt class="var">hostname</tt></i> array.</p>

<p>The function returns <tt class="const">0</tt> on successful
completion, and <tt class="const">-1</tt> on error, setting
<i><tt class="var">errno</tt></i> as usual.</p>
